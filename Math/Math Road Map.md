# 🧭 Mathematics Mastery Roadmap (Beginner → Advanced)

## 🟢 Phase 0 — Diagnose Yourself (1–2 days)

Before studying, **find your weak spots**.

**Test yourself on:**

- Fractions, percentages
    
- Solving simple equations
    
- Exponents & roots
    
- Graph reading
    
- Basic geometry
    

📌 If these feel shaky → start Phase 1  
📌 If OK → skim Phase 1 quickly
