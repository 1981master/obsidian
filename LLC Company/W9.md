### Step-by-Step Instructions for a Single-Member LLC:

1. **Line 1 – Name**
    
    - If you’re a single-member LLC taxed as a disregarded entity, put your **full legal name** (your personal name).
        
2. **Line 2 – Business Name / LLC**
    
    - Enter your **LLC name**, e.g., `Agbash Technologies LLC`.
        
3. **Line 3 – Federal Tax Classification**
    
    - Check the box for **Limited Liability Company**.
        
    - Next to it, write your tax classification:
        
        - **D** for disregarded entity (single-member LLC)
            
        - **C** for C-Corp
            
        - **S** for S-Corp
            
    - For most single-member LLCs: **D**
        
4. **Line 4 – Exemptions**
    
    - Usually blank unless your LLC is exempt from backup withholding or FATCA.
        
5. **Line 5 & 6 – Address**
    
    - Fill in your **LLC business address**.
        
6. **Line 7 – Account Numbers**
    
    - Optional; you can leave blank.
        
7. **Part I – Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN)**
    
    - **Single-member LLC:** use your **Social Security Number (SSN)** or **EIN** if you have one.
        
    - **LLC with multiple members:** use the **EIN**.
        
8. **Part II – Certification**
    
    - Sign and date the form to certify that the information is correct.

## 3️⃣ Submit W-9 to Client

- **Do not send to the IRS.**
    
- Give it directly to your **client or staffing agency**.
    
- They will use it to issue **1099-NEC forms** at year-end for your taxes.

## ✅ Tips

- Keep a **digital copy** for your records.
    
- Use your **EIN** instead of your SSN for privacy and professionalism.
    
- Update it if your LLC info changes (name, address, or tax classification).
