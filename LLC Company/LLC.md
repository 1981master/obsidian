This is a step-by-step guide for setting up your own LLC to work on

**Corp-to-Corp (C2C)** contracts.\

Keep this note in Obsidian as a reference.

  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

## ✅ Step 1: Pick a State

  

-   Choose your **home state** (simpler taxes).

-   Alternative: Delaware/Wyoming (only if you plan to scale big).

  

### 📍 Virginia Specific:

  

-   File Articles of Organization online at the [Virginia SCC Clerk's

    Information System](https://cis.scc.virginia.gov/).

-   Filing fee: **\$100** (one-time).

-   Annual Registration Fee: **\$50**, due each year on the LLC's

    anniversary month.

-   No annual report required.

  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

## ✅ Step 2: Choose a Name

  

-   Make sure it's unique in your state registry.

-   Examples:

    -   `Agbash Technologies LLC`

    -   `Mohammed Software Solutions LLC`

    -   `YourName Consulting LLC`

  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

## ✅ Step 3: File Articles of Organization

  

-   File online via your **Secretary of State** website.

-   Cost: **\$50--\$500** depending on the state.

  

### 📍 Virginia Specific:

  

-   Cost is **\$100** flat.

-   Usually processed instantly if filed online.

  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

## ✅ Step 4: Get an EIN

  

-   Apply for free on the [IRS

    Website](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online).

-   Required for taxes & business banking.

  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

## ✅ Step 5: Open a Business Bank Account

  

-   Keep personal and business finances **separate**.

-   All client payments should go into this account.

  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

## ✅ Step 6: Draft an Operating Agreement

  

-   Outlines company structure (even if single-owner).

-   Some states require it, banks may ask for it.

  

### 📍 Virginia Specific:

  

-   Virginia does **not** require an Operating Agreement, but banks and

    agencies may request it. Recommended to have one.

  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

## ✅ Step 7: Prepare for Contracts (C2C)

  

Clients/agencies may ask for:\

- Your **LLC name**\

- Your **EIN**\

- A **W-9 form**\

- Proof of **business insurance** (sometimes optional)

  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

## ✅ Step 8: Handle Taxes

  

-   LLC income is "pass-through" → reported on personal taxes.

-   Deduct expenses: laptop, internet, office, training, etc.

  

### 💰 Rough Tax Saving Rule:

  

-   Save **25--30%** of your business income in a separate account for

    taxes.

-   This covers **federal + Virginia state + self-employment** taxes.

  

### 📍 Virginia Specific:

  

-   Virginia state income tax ranges **2%--5.75%** depending on your

    income.

-   With federal + state + self-employment tax, aim for **25--30%

    savings** as a safe cushion.

  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

## ⚡ Example Workflow (C2C Payment)

  

1.  Contract rate: \$70/hr → \~\$11,200/month.\

2.  Agency/client pays your **LLC**.\

3.  Money goes into **business bank account**.\

4.  Transfer to personal account as salary/distribution.\

5.  Save **25--30%** for taxes.

  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

## 🌟 Extra Notes

  

-   Later, consider electing **S-Corp** status if income grows (can

    reduce self-employment tax).

-   You can also use your LLC for **freelance projects, SaaS ideas, or

    e-commerce**.
