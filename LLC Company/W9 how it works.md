Exactly ✅ — here’s how it works:

- **Single-member LLC (you only):** W-9 uses your **personal SSN** or **EIN**, with the LLC name and “disregarded entity” classification.
    
- **Adding members:**
    
    - Your LLC becomes a **multi-member LLC**.
        
    - For W-9, you now use the **EIN** assigned to the LLC.
        
    - The IRS considers a multi-member LLC as a **partnership** by default, so the tax classification box changes to “Limited Liability Company” with **P** for partnership.
        
- **Action:** Update all your clients with the new W-9 reflecting the LLC’s new EIN and tax classification.
    

💡 Tip: Always issue a **new W-9** whenever your LLC structure, EIN, or tax classification changes. This keeps clients’ records correct and avoids IRS issues.

If you want, I can make a **simple reference table** showing what to fill on W-9 depending on LLC type (single vs multi-member). It’s handy for quick checks.

so W9 can be update it throw the year right

Yes ✅ — a W-9 can be **updated at any time during the year**.

- Whenever any of the following changes, you should provide an **updated W-9** to your clients or agencies:
    
    1. **LLC structure changes** (e.g., single-member → multi-member)
        
    2. **EIN changes** (rare, but can happen if you reorganize)
        
    3. **Tax classification changes** (disregarded entity → S-Corp, etc.)
        
    4. **Name or address changes**
        
- **No IRS filing is needed** — the W-9 is just for your client to report payments correctly on **Form 1099-NEC**.
    

💡 Best practice: Keep a **copy of every W-9** you send and the date it was issued/updated, so you can track what your clients have on file.

If you want, I can make a **quick reference guide for W-9 updates** specifically for LLCs — when to update, what to check, and examples.

so if I have another member other than me I can h hand to him 1099 at then end of the year

Not exactly — here’s how it works when your LLC has **more than one member**:

---

## 1️⃣ Single-Member LLC

- You, as the sole member, receive all income.
    
- Clients issue **1099-NEC** to **you/your LLC**.
    
- You report the income on your personal taxes (pass-through).
    

---

## 2️⃣ Multi-Member LLC

- The IRS treats it as a **partnership** by default.
    
- The **LLC itself does not issue 1099s to members** for their share of profits.
    
- Instead:
    
    1. The LLC **files Form 1065** (partnership tax return).
        
    2. Each member gets a **Schedule K-1** showing their share of income, deductions, and credits.
        
    3. Members report income on their personal tax returns.
        
- **1099s from clients**: Clients still issue 1099-NEC **to the LLC**, not individual members.
    

---

### ✅ Key Points

- You **don’t hand 1099s to your members** — K-1s handle that internally.
    
- 1099s are only for payments **made to the entity receiving the income** (your LLC).
    
- If your LLC elects to be an **S-Corp**, then it may issue W-2s or distributions differently.
