# 🏆 Java Mastery Roadmap

This roadmap is designed for intermediate to advanced Java developers who want to **master Java** in a structured way.

---

## 1. Solidify Core Java ✅

Make sure your foundation is rock solid:

- [ ] **OOP Concepts**: Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation  
- [ ] **Java Memory Model**: Heap, Stack, Garbage Collection, Object lifecycle  
- [ ] **Collections Framework**: List, Set, Map, Queue, and performance characteristics  
- [ ] **Generics & Type Safety**: Wildcards, bounded types, type erasure  
- [ ] **Concurrency Basics**: Threads, Runnable, synchronized, volatile  

> 💡 Tip: Implement common data structures yourself in Java to reinforce understanding.

---

## 2. Advanced Java 🚀

Dive deeper into modern and advanced features:

- [ ] **Streams & Lambda Expressions**: Functional programming, parallel streams  
- [ ] **NIO & IO**: FileChannel, ByteBuffer, async IO  
- [ ] **Concurrency & Multithreading**: `ExecutorService`, `ForkJoinPool`, `CompletableFuture`  
- [ ] **Java 8+ Features**: Optional, Records, Pattern Matching, Sealed Classes  
- [ ] **Design Patterns**: Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy, Decorator  

---

## 3. JVM Internals 🔧

Understanding the JVM gives an edge in optimization:

- [ ] Class loading mechanism  
- [ ] JIT compilation & HotSpot optimizations  
- [ ] Garbage collectors (G1, ZGC, Shenandoah)  
- [ ] JVM tuning for memory and performance  

> 💡 Tip: Use `jvisualvm`, `jconsole`, or `jstack` to explore runtime behavior.

---

## 4. Build Real-World Projects 🏗️

Nothing beats hands-on experience:

- [ ] **Backend Services**: REST APIs with Spring Boot  
- [ ] **Concurrency Projects**: Multi-threaded applications, task scheduling  
- [ ] **Frameworks**: Spring, Hibernate, Kafka, RabbitMQ  
- [ ] **Testing**: JUnit, Mockito, TestContainers  

> 💡 Example Project: Real-time chat app with Spring Boot + WebSockets + multithreading.

---

## 5. Best Practices & Code Quality ✨

Write clean, maintainable, and professional code:

- [ ] SOLID Principles & Clean Code  
- [ ] Effective Exception Handling  
- [ ] Logging & Monitoring (SLF4J, Logback)  
- [ ] Unit & Integration Testing  
- [ ] Code Review & Refactoring  

---

## 6. Performance & Profiling ⚡

Learn to make your Java apps fast and efficient:

- [ ] Profiling with VisualVM or YourKit  
- [ ] Detect memory leaks  
- [ ] Optimize algorithms & data structures  
- [ ] Analyze time complexity in Java Collections  

---

## 7. Contribute & Learn from the Community 🌐

- [ ] Contribute to open-source Java projects  
- [ ] Read high-quality Java code (Spring, Netty, Apache projects)  
- [ ] Follow Java discussions on Reddit, StackOverflow, Hacker News  

---

## 8. Specialized Areas (Optional) 🎯

Expand into advanced domains:

- [ ] Reactive Programming: Project Reactor, RxJava  
- [ ] Microservices Architecture: Spring Cloud, Kubernetes  
- [ ] Security: OAuth2, JWT, Spring Security  
- [ ] Java for Big Data: Hadoop, Spark  

---

## 9. Continuous Learning 📚

- [ ] Read **Effective Java** by Joshua Bloch  
- [ ] Read **Java Concurrency in Practice** by Brian Goetz  
- [ ] Read **Clean Code** by Robert C. Martin  
- [ ] Follow Java release notes (Java 17, 21, etc.)  
- [ ] Solve advanced algorithm problems in Java (LeetCode, HackerRank)  

---

> 🔑 **Pro Tip:** Combine building projects with continuous reading and JVM exploration. This ensures practical mastery, not just theoretical knowledge.
