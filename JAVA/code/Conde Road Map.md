## 1. Java Fundamentals (Non-negotiable)

These are assumed knowledge in almost every interview.

### Core Language

- Data types, variables, operators
    
- Control flow (`if`, `switch`, loops)
    
- Arrays & Strings
    
- `String` vs `StringBuilder` vs `StringBuffer`
    
- Immutability
    

### OOP Concepts (VERY IMPORTANT)

- Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction
    
- Interfaces vs Abstract classes
    
- `final`, `static`, `this`, `super`
    
- Method overloading vs overriding
    
- Composition vs Inheritance
    

✅ Practice:

- Write small classes
    
- Implement real-world examples (Employee, BankAccount, etc.)

## 2. Collections Framework (Interview Favorite)

You’ll be tested heavily here.

### Must-Know

- `List`, `Set`, `Map`, `Queue`
    
- `ArrayList` vs `LinkedList`
    
- `HashMap` vs `TreeMap` vs `LinkedHashMap`
    
- `HashSet` vs `TreeSet`
    
- `Comparable` vs `Comparator`
    
- Internal working of `HashMap`
    

### Common Questions

- Time complexity of operations
    
- Why HashMap allows one null key
    
- How hashing works
    
- Fail-fast vs Fail-safe iterators
    

✅ Practice:

- Implement frequency counters
    
- Sort custom objects
    
- Use maps for counting problems

## 3. Exception Handling

Interviewers love edge cases.

- Checked vs Unchecked exceptions
    
- `try-catch-finally`
    
- `throw` vs `throws`
    
- Custom exceptions
    
- Exception hierarchy
    

---

## 4. Java 8+ Features (Mandatory for Modern Interviews)

If you skip this, you’re already behind.

### Java 8 Core

- Lambda expressions
    
- Functional interfaces
    
- Streams API
    
    - `map`, `filter`, `reduce`
        
    - `collect`, `groupingBy`
        
- `Optional`
    
- Method references
    

### Date & Time API

- `LocalDate`, `LocalDateTime`, `ZonedDateTime`
    

✅ Practice:

- Convert loops to streams
    
- Solve problems both with and without streams

## 5. Multithreading & Concurrency (Big Differentiator)

This separates average from strong candidates.

### Core Concepts

- Thread lifecycle
    
- `Runnable` vs `Thread`
    
- Synchronization
    
- `volatile`
    
- Deadlock, starvation, race condition
    

### Advanced

- `ExecutorService`
    
- Thread pools
    
- `Callable` & `Future`
    
- `CompletableFuture`
    
- Concurrent collections (`ConcurrentHashMap`)
    

---

## 6. JVM Internals (Mid–Senior Level)

You don’t need to be a JVM engineer, but basics matter.

- JVM vs JRE vs JDK
    
- Class loading mechanism
    
- Memory areas (Heap, Stack, Metaspace)
    
- Garbage collection basics
    
- Common GC algorithms
    

---

## 7. Data Structures & Algorithms (Coding Rounds Core)

Language knowledge alone won’t pass coding rounds.

### Data Structures

- Arrays
    
- Strings
    
- Linked List
    
- Stack & Queue
    
- Hashing
    
- Trees (BST, Binary Tree)
    
- Heaps
    
- Graphs (basics)
    

### Algorithms

- Sorting & Searching
    
- Recursion & Backtracking
    
- Two pointers
    
- Sliding window
    
- Binary search
    
- Greedy
    
- Dynamic Programming (start simple)
    

✅ Platforms:

- LeetCode
    
- HackerRank
    
- CodeSignal
    

---

## 8. Design Patterns (For Experienced Roles)

Focus on _why_, not memorization.

### Must-Know Patterns

- Singleton
    
- Factory
    
- Builder
    
- Strategy
    
- Observer
    

---

## 9. System Design (If ≥3 YOE)

For backend Java roles.

- High-level design
    
- REST APIs
    
- Scalability basics
    
- Caching
    
- Database design
    
- Microservices basics
    

---

## 10. Mock Interviews & Revision

This is where most people fail to prepare.

- Explain code out loud
    
- Time yourself
    
- Revisit weak topics
    
- Review common Java interview questions
    

---

## Suggested 8–10 Week Plan

**Weeks 1–2:** Core Java + OOP  
**Weeks 3–4:** Collections + Java 8  
**Weeks 5–6:** DSA (daily problems)  
**Week 7:** Multithreading + JVM  
**Week 8:** Design patterns + mocks

---

If you want, I can:

- Make this **company-specific** (FAANG / startups)
    
- Create a **daily study plan**
    
- Share **top Java interview questions**
    
- Tailor it based on your **experience level**
    

Just tell me 👍
