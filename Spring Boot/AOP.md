Absolutely! Each type of advice—`@Before`, `@After`, and `@Around`—has its own set of parameters that you can use.

**1. `@Before` Advice:**

- **`JoinPoint`**: Provides details about the method being called, like the method name, arguments, and target object.
    
- **`Arguments`**: You can access the method arguments directly.
    
- **`Signature`**: Gives you information about the method signature, including return type and parameters.
    

**Example of `@Before` Advice:**

```java
@Before("execution(* com.example.MyService.performAction(..))")
public void logBeforeMethod(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
    System.out.println("Before method: " + joinPoint.getSignature().getName());
    System.out.println("Arguments: " + Arrays.toString(joinPoint.getArgs()));
}

```

**2. `@After` Advice:**

- **`JoinPoint`**: Similar to `@Before`, it gives you information about the method that just completed.
    
- **`Return Value`**: For `@AfterReturning` advice, you can access the method's return value.
    
- **`Exception`**: For `@AfterThrowing` advice, you can access the exception thrown.
    

**Example of `@After` and `@AfterReturning` Advice:**

```java
@After("execution(* com.example.MyService.performAction(..))")
public void logAfterMethod(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
    System.out.println("After method: " + joinPoint.getSignature().getName());
}

@AfterReturning(pointcut = "execution(* com.example.MyService.performAction(..))", returning = "result")
public void logAfterReturning(JoinPoint joinPoint, Object result) {
    System.out.println("Method returned: " + result);
}

```

**3. `@Around` Advice:**

- **`ProceedingJoinPoint`**: This allows you to control the execution of the method. You can proceed with the method call or modify the arguments or the return value.
    
- **`Proceed()`**: You can control when and if the original method is called.
    
- **`Arguments`**: You can inspect and modify the method arguments before proceeding.
    

**Example of `@Around` Advice:**

```java
@Around("execution(* com.example.MyService.performAction(..))")
public Object aroundMethod(ProceedingJoinPoint pjp) throws Throwable {
    System.out.println("Around: Before method execution");

    // You can modify arguments if needed
    Object[] args = pjp.getArgs();
    // For example, modify the first argument
    // args[0] = modifiedValue;

    // Proceed with the original method
    Object result = pjp.proceed(args);

    System.out.println("Around: After method execution");

    // You can modify the result before returning it
    return result;
}

```

By using these parameters, you get a lot of flexibility and control over how and when the aspect logic runs. This can help you handle cross-cutting concerns effectively and cleanly. If you have more questions or need more details, just let me know!

You're welcome! If you have any other questions or need further examples down the line,

“Yes, can you show me what's the meaning of using stars, like execution stars, and sometimes they use like couple series stars, what about the argument, stuff like this, and what was their meaning of how they're using it?”

Of course! In the context of Spring AOP, when you see the `JoinPoint` or `ProceedingJoinPoint`, the term "execution" refers to the particular point in the program where a method or constructor is called.

Here’s a quick breakdown:

- **`execution`**: This is the pointcut designator that matches method executions. For example, `execution(* com.example.MyService.performAction(..))` matches the execution of the `performAction` method in the `MyService` class.
    
- **`args`**: This refers to the method arguments passed to the method at that join point. You can access them via `joinPoint.getArgs()`.
    
- **`signature`**: This gives you details about the method itself, like its name, return type, and parameters.
    
- **`proceed()`**: In the case of `@Around` advice, `proceed()` is used to continue the execution of the original method. You can also modify the arguments before calling `proceed()`, and you can manipulate the returned value as well.
    

All of these elements help you get a detailed look at what’s happening at that particular join point, making it easier to implement cross-cutting concerns like logging, security checks, and more.

If there's any particular part that you’d like more detail on, just let me know!

is this only attribute that can take and what is * meaing here: "execution(* com.example.MyService.performAction(..))"

Great question! The `execution` pointcut designator in Spring AOP is quite flexible, and it can take several elements to define the method signature you want to match.

Here’s a breakdown of the `execution` syntax:

- **Return Type (`*`)**: The asterisk `*` means any return type. You can replace it with a specific return type if you want. For example, `void` or `int`.
    
- **Package and Class (`com.example.MyService`)**: This specifies the fully qualified name of the class where the method is located.
    
- **Method Name (`performAction`)**: The specific method name you want to match. If you want to match any method, you can use `*`.
    
- **Arguments (`(..)`)**: The double parentheses `(..)` mean any number of arguments of any type. You can also specify argument types if needed, for example `(String, int)` for specific types and counts.
    

So, `execution(* com.example.MyService.performAction(..))` means that we’re matching the execution of the `performAction` method in `MyService` regardless of what it returns and regardless of the arguments it takes.

You can get more granular by specifying return types, method names, and argument types as needed. This flexibility allows you to pinpoint exactly which method calls you want to intercept.

If you have more questions about any of these elements, feel free to ask!

Eg:
`execution(* com.master.practiceReact.repository..*(..))`

is a **Spring AOP pointcut expression** written in **AspectJ syntax**.

You usually see it inside something like:

`@Around("execution(* com.master.practiceReact.repository..*(..))")`

---

# 🔍 Let’s Break It Down

## 1️⃣ `execution(...)`

This is a **pointcut designator** in Spring AOP.

It means:

> “Intercept method execution that matches this pattern.”

So we are targeting **method executions**.

---

## 2️⃣ `*`

The first `*` means:

> Any return type

So it matches:

`public String findUser() public void deleteUser() public int count()`

All of them match because return type is `*`.

---

## 3️⃣ `com.master.practiceReact.repository..`

This part means:

> All classes inside this package and its sub-packages

The `..` is important.

- `repository.*` → only classes directly inside repository
    
- `repository..` → classes inside repository AND all sub-packages
    

Example matches:

`com.master.practiceReact.repository.UserRepo com.master.practiceReact.repository.impl.UserRepoImpl com.master.practiceReact.repository.custom.SpecialRepo`

---

## 4️⃣ `*(..)`

This part means:

- `*` → any method name
    
- `(..)` → any parameters (zero or more, any type)
    

So it matches:

`save(User user) findById(Long id) deleteAll() customMethod(String name, int age)`

All of them match.

---

# 🧠 So What Does The Whole Expression Mean?

`execution(* com.master.practiceReact.repository..*(..))`

It means:

> Intercept **ALL methods**  
> with **ANY return type**  
> inside **ANY class**  
> in package `com.master.practiceReact.repository`  
> and its sub-packages  
> with **ANY parameters**

---

# 🧱 Real Example

```java
@Aspect
@Component
public class LoggingAspect {

    @Before("execution(* com.master.practiceReact.repository..*(..))")
    public void logBefore() {
        System.out.println("Repository method called!");
    }
}

```

Now:

Every time ANY repository method runs → it logs.

---

# 📦 When Is This Used?

Usually for:

- Logging
    
- Performance tracking
    
- Security checks
    
- Transactions
    
- Auditing
    
- Caching
    

---

# ⚡ Quick Visual Summary

|Part|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`execution`|Match method execution|
|`*`|Any return type|
|`repository..`|This package + subpackages|
|`*`|Any method name|
|`(..)`|Any parameters|
