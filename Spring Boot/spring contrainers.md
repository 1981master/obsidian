In Spring, the main container is the ApplicationContext, which is essentially the core container that holds and manages all your beans. Within the Spring ecosystem, there are different types of containers, like the `BeanFactory` (which is a more basic container) and the `ApplicationContext` (which is more feature-rich and commonly used). There are also specialized contexts, like the `WebApplicationContext` for web applications. But generally, the `ApplicationContext` is the primary container that you’ll interact with in a Spring Boot application.

In general, the main ones are the `BeanFactory` and the `ApplicationContext`, with the `ApplicationContext` being the more advanced and commonly used one. However, there are also other specialized containers or contexts in the Spring ecosystem. For example, the `WebApplicationContext` is a specialized extension of the `ApplicationContext` tailored for web applications. There are also some more niche contexts, like the `GenericWebApplicationContext`, and in certain cases, frameworks or libraries might introduce their own container-like structures. But in the vast majority of typical Spring and Spring Boot applications, the `ApplicationContext` is the main container you'll work with.
